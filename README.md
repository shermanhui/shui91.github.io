# Personal Portfolio Website 
--------

This is my personal portfolio hosted on github. 

This project was originally based off of Udacity's "Build a Portfolio Website" Project where students were given a design mock up to replicate in HTML and CSS.

This page has now evolved to display my personal accomplishments, resume, past projects, and a contact me page.

To access the online portfolio, visit shui91.github.io


## Features
--------

- Organized to display my top four projects
- Made with responsiveness in mind, using Bootstrap
- jQuery used for DOM manipulation and for responsive elements on the page
	- Such as "Where I've Lived and Work" feature found in the resume section
	- Animated chart displaying technical skills
